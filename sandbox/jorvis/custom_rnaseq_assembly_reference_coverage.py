## tracked in SILLAB-unk, this script was written to answer a specific set of questions, namely:

# 1.1 How many genes in the current annotation have evidence from the assembled transcripts?
# What I would say counts for evidence is the whole gene included within the start/end of the transcript coordinates (regardless of whether or not the transcript covers multiple genes); I say for now we ignore partial overlaps.

# 1.2 How many genes structures will be modified as a result of the transcriptome sequencing? 
# This is obviously a very broad and involved question (or the answer is, rather, because of all this issue of multigene transcripts). So, we need a simplified version of this question that might give us the lower boundary of that number, while being reasonable doable. So, I was thinking two things:

# 1.2.1 How many transcripts cover no currently annotated genes? I have seen a few in IGV while randomly browsing, so I assume this is a non-trivial numberâ€¦

# 1.2.2 Would it be possible to determine, of the genes with transcript coverage, how many introns have incorrect boundaries? Essentially, the %incorrect introns, and how many genes that maps to.

# Here, I assume 1.2.1 is easier than 1.2.2, but I don't know if you already have the necessary tools to actually do 1.2.2. If you do, fine, if not, we could see what number 1.2.1 comes up to, and see if that shows enough of an impact, before determining if we need to go on to 1.2.2.
